Well, this is the Decker source code. I wrote it for myself, so it may be a little confusing. I will try to outline what is in each directory.

Directory - Contents
--------------------
<Main> - All code files for main program.
Res - Game resource files (bitmaps, icons, etc. which are compiled into the executable.)
Help - The help file source.
Setup - The Setup program project and source files.

bin - files for making install. Run MakeCab.bat to create an install disk.
DefaultGraphics - The graphics that are packaged in the install
Sound - The sound effects which are packaged in the install.

Ideas - Ideas which I had concerning the game which have not been implemented.
UnusedGraphics - Bitmaps which I never used.
UserSubmittedGraphics - Images submitted by various users.
